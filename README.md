# Combining EEG and Eye-Tracking in Virtual Reality - Obtaining Fixation-Onset ERPs and ERSPs

The project implemented and tested an eye-movement classification algorithm for data recorded in a 3d, free-viewing, and free-movement virtual environment. It is a velocity-based classification based on the algorithms of the MAD saccade (Keshava et al., 2023; Voloh et al., 2020) and REMoDNav (Dar et al., 2021). The code has been tested in combination with EEG data and can be used to generate fERPs and fERSPs.
The scripts provided here include the classification algorithm itself, analysis scripts, and preprocessing scripts for both eye-tracking and EEG data.
